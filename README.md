This project is a simple and human-friendly machine learning model that predicts the weather using just three inputs: place, temperature, and humidity. The main idea behind this work was to experiment with the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier and understand how a model behaves when trained on a small, manually created dataset. I included four major Indian cities—Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Bangalore—and assigned each sample a weather label of either “Sunny” or “Rain.” The dataset may be small, but it serves as a great starting point for visualizing how probabilistic models handle classification.

Once the model is trained, the program takes user input and predicts whether it is likely to be sunny or rainy. It also estimates the probability of rain, which gives a much clearer picture of how confident the model is. To make the output more meaningful, the program converts the humidity value into a simple category—high, moderate, or low—and provides a rough estimation of when rain is expected, such as morning, afternoon, or evening. While the time window is not based on actual meteorological data, it helps make the output feel more intuitive and user-friendly.

To evaluate the model's performance, a confusion matrix is generated and displayed as a heatmap. This makes it easy to see how many predictions were correct and where the model made mistakes. Even with a small dataset, the confusion matrix helps highlight whether the model tends to overpredict sunny days or misses rainy cases. It also provides a quick visual understanding of how well the classifier performed on unseen test data.

Overall, this project is a simple demonstration of how Naive Bayes can be used for weather classification. It balances machine learning concepts with interactive user inputs, probability-based predictions, and performance visualization. Although small in scale, it can be expanded with more data, more cities, or even real-time weather APIs to become a much more accurate and insightful prediction tool.
